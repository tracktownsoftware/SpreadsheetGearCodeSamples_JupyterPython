# SpreadsheetGear code samples for Python in Jupyter Notebooks #

These code samples have been tested in [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Packages used by Spreadsheetgear code samples for Python and Jupyter Notebooks: ##
*   **[SpreadsheetGear Engine for .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpreadsheetGear/9.1.44-beta)** - A Nuget package that is the primary SpreadsheetGear library and provides a core set of APIs to read, write, manipulate and calculate workbooks, build charts, format worksheets and cells, and more. Learn more about SpreadsheetGear products on its [Features Page](https://www.spreadsheetgear.com/Products/Features) and [Comparison Page](https://www.spreadsheetgear.com/Products/Compare).
*   **[Python.NET](https://pypi.org/project/pythonnet/)** - A Python Package (PyPI) that allows Python code to interact with the .NET CLR and the SpreadsheetGear Engine for .NET.

## Options to view and run SpreadsheetGear code samples in this repository: ##
1. In Github Codespaces use a browser based Visual Studio Code editor (no installation required)
2. In Github Codespaces use your local Visual Studio Code editor (no other installation required) 
3. Clone this repo and use its [devcontainer configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container) and your local Visual Studio Code editor (you need Docker Desktop to host the devcontainer)
4. Clone this repo and use your local Visual Studio Code editor with all requirements installed.
